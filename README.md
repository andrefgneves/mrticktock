##About

This app comes mainly from my need to start/stop my tasks on the go. Sometimes I leave the office and forget to stop timing what I was doing, Using the site on the iPhone, although doable, is a pain, so I thought it would be a cool personal project while we wait for the official app.

I'm using the "unadvertised" API found on <a href="http://mrticktock.com">MrTickTock</a>'s Windows gadget.

There's a lot of room for improvement and still lots to be done but it's already usable.


###Installing

Make sure you have (*the awesome*) [cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org) installed on your Mac, then:

1. git clone https://github.com/andrefgneves/MrTickTock.git
2. cd MrTickTock
3. pod install
4. open MrTickTock.xcworkspace
5. build, run and have fun


### Plans

I'll be fixing bugs and adding features on a "when I feel like it" basis but feel free to use this anyway you want.
